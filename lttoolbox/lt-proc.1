.SH DESCRIPTION
.BR lt-proc 
is the application responsible for providing the four lexical
processing functionalities

.RS
\(bu \fImorphological analyser\fR  ( option \fB\-a\fR )
.PP
\(bu \fIlexical transfer\fR  ( option \fB\-n\fR )
.PP
\(bu \fImorphological generator\fR  ( option \fB\-g\fR )
.PP
\(bu \fIpost-generator\fR  ( option \fB\-p\fR )
.RE
\fR
.PP
It accomplishes these tasks by reading binary files containing a
compact and efficient representation of dictionaries (a class of
finite-state transducers called augmented letter transducers). These
files are generated by \fBlt\-comp(1)\fR.
.PP
It is worth to mention that some characters
(`\fB[\fR', `\fB]\fR', `\fB$\fR', `\fB^\fR', `\fB/\fR', `\fB+\fR') are
\fIspecial\fR chars used for format and encapsulation. They should be
escaped if they have to be used literally, for
instance: `\fB[\fR'...`\fB]\fR' are ignored and the format of a
\fIlinefeed\fR is `\fB^\fR...\fB$\fR'.
.SH OPTIONS
.TP
.B \-a, \-\-analysis
Tokenizes the text in surface forms (lexical units as they appear in
texts) and delivers, for each surface form, one or more lexical forms
consisting of lemma, lexical category and morphological inflection
information. Tokenization is not straightforward due to the existence,
on the one hand, of contractions, and, on the other hand, of
multi-word lexical units. For contractions, the system reads in a
single surface form and delivers the corresponding sequence of lexical
forms. Multi-word surface forms are analysed in a left-to-right,
longest-match fashion. Multi-word surface forms may be invariable
(such as a multi-word preposition or conjunction) or inflected (for
example, in es, \fI"echaban de menos"\fR, \(dqthey missed\(dq, is a
form of the imperfect indicative tense of the verb \fI"echar de
menos"\fR, \(dqto miss\(dq). Limited support for some kinds of
discontinuous multi-word units is also available. Single-word surface
forms analysis produces output like the one in these examples:
\ \fI"cantar"\fR \-> `\fI^cantar/cantar<vblex><inf>$\fR' or
\ `\fI"daba"\fR \->
\ `\fI^daba/dar<vblex><pii><p1><sg>/dar<vblex><pii><p3><sg>$\fR'.
.TP
.B \-b, \-\-bilingual
Does lexical transference, attaching queues of morphological symbols
not specified in the dictionaries. As the analysis mode, supports
multiple lexical forms in the target language for a given lexical
form in the source language. Works typically with the output of
apertium-pretransfer.
.TP
.B \-o, \-\-surf\-bilingual
As with \-b, but takes input from apertium\-tagger \-p , with
surface forms, and if the lexical form is not found in the bilingual
dictionary, it outputs the surface form of the word. 
.TP

.B \-c, \-\-case\-sensitive
Use the literal case of the incoming characters
.TP
.B \-d, \-\-debugged\-gen
Morph. generation with all the stuff
.TP
.B \-e, \-\-decompose\-compounds
Try to treat unknown words as compounds, and decompose them.
.TP
.B \-w, \-\-dictionary\-case
Use the case information contained in the lexicon, instead of the surface
case (only applied in analysis mode).
.TP
.B \-g, \-\-generation
Delivers a target-language surface form for each target-language
lexical form, by suitably inflecting it.
.TP
.B \-n, \-\-non\-marked\-gen
Morphological generation (like \fB\-g\fR) but without unknown word
marks (asterisk `*').
.TP
.B \-b, \-\-tagged\-gen
Morphological generation (like \fB\-g\fR) but retaining part-of-speech
tags.
.TP
.B \-p, \-\-post\-generation
Performs orthographical operations such as contractions and
apostrophations. The post-generator is usually \fIdormant\fR (just
copies the input to the output) until a special \fIalarm\fR symbol
contained in some target-language surface forms \fIwakes\fR it up to
perform a particular string transformation if necessary; then it goes
back to sleep.
.TP
.B \-s, \-\-sao
Input processing is in \fIorthoepikon\fR (previously `\fIsao\fR')
annotation system format: \fBhttp://orthoepikon.sf.net\fR.
.TP
.B \-t, \-\-transliteration
Apply a transliteration dictionary
.TP
.B \-i, \-\-ignored\-chars icx_file
Ignores characters specified in the file icx_file
.TP
.B \-z, \-\-null\-flush
Flush output on the null character
.TP
.B \-v, \-\-version
Display the version number.
.TP
.B \-h, \-\-help
Display this help.
.SH FILES
.B input_file
The input compiled dictionary.
