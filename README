1. Programs

    lt-comp     -> compiler, execute without parameters to show the
                   instructions of use.

    lt-proc     -> processor, works with options -a (lexical analyser, 
                   default option), -g (lexical generator) and -p 
                   (lexical post-generator).  Using -h will show all 
                   flags.

    lt-expand   -> generates all the pairs of transductions of a given
                   dictionary.  Execute without parameters to show the
                   instructions of use.

    lt-trim     -> (experimental) trims a compiled analyser to only
                   contain entries which would pass through a compiled
                   bidix, creating a new compiled and trimmed analyser.

    lt-reweight -> (experimental) utility to assign weights to a
                   compiled transducer based on a corpus.
